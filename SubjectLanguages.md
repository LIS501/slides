# Subject Languages

- Subject languages have vocabularies, semantics, and semantics.
- The first important distinction is what *kind of thing* is a topic or subject
    - Are things in the world topics? If so, your subject language might be an ontology.
    - Or are topics conceptual? In that case, a thesaurus, subject headings, or a classification.

- Syntax: how lexemes are allowed to be combined.
- Semantics: how grammatical strings relate to each other and to what they denote.

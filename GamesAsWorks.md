# Boyden on Games

> Games seem to straddle the boundaries between copyright and patent,

# Boyden on Games

> Games convey an experience of play to users, just as music and drama
> convey an aesthetic or narrative experience to viewers and
> listeners. But the experience of game play emerges primarily from

# Boyden on the essence of games

- Rules "define the boundaries of the game, but they do not specify
  precisely what occurs during a game in play."
- Rules "not only govern the behavior of the players, but they provide
  the meaning of what happens within the game-space."
- "Players are necessary for the full realization of games in a way
  that musicians, actors, DVD players, and MP3 players are not.

# Boyden on means and ends

- Lusory and pre-lusory goals differ from the functional and technical goals of
  patentable processes.

- Works of authorship are "like a path through a maze that has been
  mapped out by the author and is only gradually revealed to the
  audience. [...] A game, however, is just the maze."

# Boyden on Systems

- "Defining 'systems' as any group of interrelated elements forming a
  complex whole would sweep in not only games, but almost all
  copyrightable works as well."

- But abstract state machines link initial states to goal states via
  transition functions that are realized via rules.

- That's what games share with other non-copyrightable systems like
  notation systems.

# Games as form without content

> A game, as sold, is only a game form; the content necessary for an
> instance of the game comes from the players. That is, the game form
> establishes the environment for play— the game space—and it defines
> permissible moves and the conditions for winning or drawing. But the
> game itself is supplied by the players.

# Expression as carrier of information

- "Works that convey information—in the form of education,
  entertainment, or aesthetics—are within the domain of
  copyright. Works that perform any other function are excluded."

- But "the nature of the transmission of information from creator to
  audience is importantly different in a game as compared to music and
  plays."

- That difference is in "the connection between the expression that is
  contained, or “fixed,” in the work and the intellectual experience
  of the audience. Music and plays encode and transmit a protected
  aesthetic or intellectual experience from author to audience. Games,
  however, do not transmit the game-playing experience; they merely
  create the conditions for it to occur."

# Experience of games more varied than drama or music

- "This is true even though sheet music, scripts, and other works
  allow considerable flexibility in performance."

- "Music and plays are normally communications through the 'players'
  to an audience of other people."

- But game players "do not convey the game designer’s expression
  further." Game moves don't communicate with an audience.

- "That is, game play is not expressive. A game session is therefore
  not a 'performance' of the expression.

# Transmission vs. some other function

- The key issue is "whether the expression that is transmitted from
  author to user is the primary source of meaning. In other words, is
  the material in question directly communicating some message to the
  user?"

- "Systems or procedures for which the user himself supplies the
  critical informational or creative inputs are uncopyrightable."

# LIS501: What it isn't
 - This is a required course for the MS degree.
 - But the course is not an introduction to LIS as a whole or to the
   profession of librarianship.
 - If we're going to require a course, why don't we make it an introduction
   to professional practice?

# LIS501: What it is

LIS501 is an introduction to fundamentals of information organization
and access from an LIS point of view. That means we'll examine topics
such as: 

 - how information is expressed and structured,
 - how people try to resolve information problems, and
 - attempts to reform the former, in the interests of improving the latter.

# A general introduction to librarianship
 - If such a course were possible, we would be teaching it.
 - But what makes our professions distinctive is the service role we play in
   helping to advance the aims of a community.
 - This generally involves exercising stewardship over abundant,
   non-rivalrous, cultural resources. 
 - But that's very broad, and the ways in which we bring our expertise to
   meeting community and organizational needs are very diverse.
 - What that means is that problems you'll face on the job will have a 
   common shape to them, but the details will be very different, even from
   week to week on the same job.
 - Leadership and initiative will tend to be demanded earlier than in other
   professional fields, often against the constraints imposed by
   resources that are scarce and rivalrous.

# You are enrolled in a graduate degree
 - Schools of LIS in the US promote the view that meeting these professional
   challenges calls for education beyond the undergraduate degree.
 - We believe that acquainting you with research and scholarship on problems
   of information organization and access will actually help you on the job.
 - Some of you aspire to work in positions where you will be expected to 
   conduct original research.
 - But there's a lot more professional preparation beyond the
   classroom that you can work on while you're here.

# LIS501: What it isn't
 - This is a required course for the MS degree in LIS.
 - But the course is not an introduction to LIS as a whole or to the
   profession of librarianship.
 - If we're going to require a course, why don't we make it an introduction
   to professional practice?

# LIS501: What it is

LIS501 is an introduction to fundamentals of information organization
and access from an LIS point of view. That means we'll examine topics
such as: 

 - how information is expressed and structured,
 - how people try to resolve information problems, and
 - attempts to reform the former, in the interests of improving the latter.

# A general introduction to librarianship
 - If such a course were possible, we would be teaching it.
 - But what makes our professions distinctive is the service role we play in
   helping to advance the aims of a community.
 - This generally involves exercising stewardship over abundant,
   non-rivalrous, cultural resources. 
 - But that's very broad, and the ways in which we bring our expertise to
   meeting community and organizational needs are very diverse.
 - What that means is that problems you'll face on the job will have a 
   common shape to them, but the details will be very different, even from
   week to week on the same job.
 - Leadership and initiative will tend to be demanded earlier than in other
   professional fields, often against the constraints imposed by
   resources that are scarce and rivalrous.

# You are enrolled in a graduate degree
 - Schools of LIS in the US promote the view that meeting these professional
   challenges calls for education beyond the undergraduate degree.
 - We believe that acquainting you with research and scholarship on problems
   of information organization and access will actually help you on the job:
       1.  Our graduates conduct and publish both academic research and
           institutional evaluation studies.

       2.  Understanding research aims and practices is necessary for
           working in partnership with and in support of people in the
           communities that we serve.

       3.  Reading and understanding published research will be part
           of your other classes.

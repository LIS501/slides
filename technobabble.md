# How important is accuracy?

- Kyle Banerjee is a graduate of our MS program.
- On his LinkedIn profile he claims to have an MLS in Library Science.
- Strictly speaking, that's completely false.
- But for purposes of telling people what degree you have, are the
  fine distinctions between an MLS in Library Science and an MS in LIS
  really important or helpful?

# Mansplaining Technobabble

- The 2017 *Computers in Libraries* article is intended to get you past some
  intimidating jargon, and reassure you that the concepts behind the terms are
  intuitive and familiar.
- In making these ideas accessible, he offers explanations that aren't
  true. At all.
- But the most important question is raised by the article's title: exactly
  how much is 'all you need to know' really?

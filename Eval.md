# Quantification and Understanding

> I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about,
> and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you
> cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your
> knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the
> beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts,
> advanced to the stage of \emph{science}, whatever the matter may be.

# University Library Goals and Metrics

From the Strategic Plan website: <https://strategicplan.illinois.edu/units/library.html>

- Provide transformative learning experiences
    - Number of total participants in group presentations
    - Number of reference transactions
    - On-site visits to the libraries
    - Reserve course readings (electronic and print)
    - Number of student research journals published by Library
    - Reservations of student collaborative spaces
- Make a significant and visible societal impact	
    - Total number of filled ILL requests provided to other libraries
    - Count of books in Google Books and HathiTrust
    - IDEALS downloads
    - Curated exhibits on- or off-campus, incl. in libraries and
      partnerships with Krannert
    - Number of "last copy" items added to print repository from
      Illinois libraries

# ServQual Instrument

From [@nitecki_changing_1996]

\textbf{Reliability} (Statements 5 through 9)

5. When excellent libraries’ ILL units promise to do something by a
   certain time, they will do so.
6. When a user has a problem, excellent libraries’ ILL units will show
   a sincere interest in solving it.
7. Excellent libraries will perform ILL services right the first time.
8. Excellent libraries will provide ILL services at the time they
   promise to do so.
9. Excellent libraries’ ILL units will insist on error-free records.

# ServQual Instrument

\textbf{For perceptions of received services}

5. When Test Library ILL unit promises to do something by a certain
   time, it does so.
6. When an ILL user has a problem, Test Library shows a sincere
   interest in solving it.
7. Test Library performs ILL services right the first time.
8. Test Library provides its ILL services at the time it promises to
   do so.
9. Test Library’s ILL unit insists on error-free records.

# Factors informing the design of a scaling method

1. Basic philosophy of measurement [@michell90]
    - Operationalism
    - Representational Theory
    - Aristotelian
2. Geometric Interpretation of Data (Coombs model: see [@jacoby1991data]
    - Items being related interpreted as elements of same set vs. different sets.
    - Pair relationship interpreted as partial order vs. proximity.
3. Scaling model assumptions (see [@mciver1981unidimensional])
    - Thurstonian scaling
    - Likert scaling
    - Guttman scaling
    - Coombs unfolding model
    - (many others)

# ISO 9001 Requirements for Quality Management Systems

There's a lot more to these. See [@balague2011managing].

- Address statutory and regulatory requirements.
- Identify organizational processes relevant to quality management.
- Identify and document criteria for the effectiveness of those processes.
- Ensure the availability of resources for those processes.
- Monitor, measure, and analyze the processes.
- Take actions to ensure continued improvement.
